## Log agent papercuts

When you hit **small friction** while working — a tool call that missed and had
to be retried, a confusing or undocumented setup step, a flaky command, a stale
cache, a misleading error, a non-obvious gotcha — log it via:

```bash
papercut -m <model> "one or two sentences: what you were doing → what got in the way"
```

Data lives under **`.agent-papercuts/`** (open list + history), not a root
`PAPERCUTS.md`, so it does not collide with product files. Do this
**proactively, in the moment**.

Sand: skill **papercuts** ("fix the papercuts"). Clear with `papercut resolve`
(not hand-delete). Long cycle: **papercuts-kaizen**.
